# Active development context

Use this page to resume current work. It intentionally links to detailed
contracts and evidence instead of repeating their history.

## Objective

Reach a repeatable native Linux 7.1.4 minimal server on the ASUS ROG Phone 5:
read-only network root, USB NCM, key-only SSH, bounded rollback, and private
postmortem evidence. Keep installed Alpine configuration and authorization
unchanged; any shell-history or read-induced atime effect requires a separate
action-scoped guard. Use temporary `fastboot boot` only.

GPU, display, desktop, browser automation, hotspot, persistent installation,
and newer-kernel rebases remain frozen until the headless core passes.

## Proven boundary

- The shell-free framed recovery protocol, signed runtime bundle, one-shot
  controller, rollback, and fallback cleanup pass hardware-free tests.
- The accepted Linux 7.1.4 source, corrected DTB, and minimal Kconfig pass the
  [compatibility oracle](core-compatibility-oracle.md) and
  [source/DTB contract](core-source-dtb-contract.md). The retained real source,
  DTB, configuration, modules, buttons/indicator contract, and complete
  phone-free successor gate were
  [revalidated together](../test-results/2026-07-31-accepted-core-baseline-revalidation.md).
- The corrected DTB keeps UFS and USB3 isolated while preserving CPU/RAM,
  USB2/NCM, PSCI, and static thermal topology.
- A credential-clean SSH-only Arch root and fixture-key v3 package/candidate
  reproduce offline. Fixture identities can never pass deployment admission.
- The [88-field runtime gate](minimal-headless-runtime-acceptance.md) checks
  CPU/RAM, exact NFS/OverlayFS mounts, zero phone-storage exposure, USB/NCM,
  key-only SSH, thermals, and the armed rollback process.
- Local CI and GitHub Actions cover the generic QEMU boot, recovery protocol,
  candidate packaging, runtime parsers, rollback, and repository policy.

These facts do not prove the corrected candidate on the phone.

## Active deployment checkpoint

The complete non-fixture identity chain is built and passes hardware-free
admission:

- a dedicated Ed25519 SSH public key is embedded in the minimal root;
- the sealed v3 root, candidate, signed manifest, recovery trust root, and
  reproducible wrapper are mutually bound;
- the exact hashes are pinned by `headless-ssh-deployment-v3`; and
- the real artifact preflight passes without contacting the phone.

See the
[deployment-chain result](../test-results/2026-07-31-headless-ssh-deployment-chain-offline.md).

The host deployment boundary now passes:

- the reviewed SteamOS export-store remediation is pushed and installed;
- the no-replace v3 lower is published below the root-owned `/home` store;
- local key admission, sealed-root, fixed NFS, artifact, and
  connected-fastboot checks pass; and
- the one authorized temporary boot remains unused.

The lifecycle no longer depends on fallback client-key authorization. A fixed
USB ACM controller now sends one nonce-bound read-only health payload to the
exact Alpine serial interface. Alpine signs the canonical result with its existing
Ed25519 SSH host key; the host verifies it against the private mode-`0600`
pin retained outside Git. The protocol binds kernel/init/compatible/root,
modules, pstore, dmesg, thermals, Python, boot ID, and physical USB location.
Its separately guarded reboot path requires a verified ACK, rechecks the same
boot, uses only `RESTART2("bootloader")`, and then requires the same port and
exact `lahaina` fastboot product. A source audit of Alpine 3.24 and BusyBox
1.37 found that the installed legacy interactive shell can record the
launcher before starting its child. Reads from the writable `relatime` ext4
root may also update inode access times. The controller therefore requires
`ALLOW_FALLBACK_ACM_STORAGE_WRITE=1`; it has no explicit storage-write, mount,
flash, `authorized_keys`, or fallback-configuration path. Its launcher stays
below Alpine's 2,048-byte line-editor bound, starts Python in isolated/no-site
mode, and waits for a nonce-bound loader-ready marker before sending bounded,
hash-checked source chunks. The host drains bounded interactive-shell echoes
while writing and sends one atomic Ctrl-C plus split-literal nonce marker to
reject a stale or partial shell line before the loader. Write failures retain
their exact stage and byte progress. A phone-side deadline rejects missing or
partial delivery without execution. Non-reboot actions return to the same
supervised shell rather than depending on a replacement shell to respawn.
Before any temporary boot, lifecycle preflight now validates the
allowed-signers pin, fixed host tooling, ModemManager state, wait range,
loader bounds, and the 3,600-second contact-start/7,200-second anchor-age
contract without opening ACM. The recovery anchor is directly bound to its
real producer and is revalidated after ACM discovery to cover host suspend.
Nonce-bound phone errors retain their failure class through the last bounded
serial read. Host cleanup validates the root-owned canonical NFS export table
directly; it no longer mistakes unprivileged `exportfs` lock diagnostics for
an active export.

Thirty-nine hardware-free ACM tests and all seventeen lifecycle methods
pass. A physical reboot restored the supervised ACM reader. The fresh signed
exchange then exposed a stale thermal assumption: the installed fallback now
publishes 96 contiguous zones, including unsupported auxiliary channels,
rather than exactly 70 universally readable temperatures. The controller now
requires a bounded contiguous topology, a stable readable quorum, named core
CPU/GPU/system sensors, and the unchanged hard temperature ceilings while
ignoring unreadable temperatures only for an exact observed auxiliary-type
allowlist, plus zero and Qualcomm-inactive values.
One fresh nonce-bound preflight passed and its mode-`0600` signed proof is
retained outside Git. The one authorized temporary boot remains unused. See
the [live acceptance](../test-results/2026-07-31-fallback-acm-preflight-live-accepted.md)
and preceding
[reader rejection](../test-results/2026-07-31-fallback-acm-preflight-live-rejected.md).

See the
[real-host deployment result](../test-results/2026-07-31-steamos-deployment-preflight-live.md).
The replacement fallback control boundary is recorded in the
[authenticated ACM result](../test-results/2026-07-31-fallback-acm-control-offline.md).

The reproducible commands and credential metadata rules are in
[Build the non-fixture chain](minimal-headless-live-cycle.md#build-the-non-fixture-chain).

Tracked execution **HOLD**: repository state never records an operator's live
authorization. Credential use and each temporary boot require explicit
invocation-time authorization after every preflight passes.

The authoritative procedure is the
[minimal-headless lifecycle runbook](minimal-headless-live-cycle.md).

## One-cycle acceptance

The controller must:

1. verify one `lahaina` fastboot device and the exact recovery artifacts;
2. use temporary boot only;
3. anchor the recovery and target USB gadgets to the same physical port;
4. transfer one signed bundle, then close the bundle server;
5. start the fixed read-only NFSv4.2 export and issue one non-retryable
   `COMMIT_EXEC`;
6. pin the volatile target host key without TOFU;
7. collect and verify one strict-SSH runtime record while rollback stays
   armed;
8. verify the returned Alpine fallback through its signed, nonce-bound ACM
   health record;
9. prove all host network/export state is removed; and
10. resolve the durable intent as accepted or fallback-returned.

Transport loss without enough correlated evidence remains `UNKNOWN`; it
never authorizes another execute.

## After the core cycle

If the core runtime passes, continue in this order:

1. physical power/volume keys and bounded default-off indicator pulse;
2. sustained read-only battery telemetry and charger-state comparison;
3. CPU cooling, PMIC alarm registration, and bounded thermal fallback;
4. panel-off operation, suspend/wake, SSH continuity, and idle power;
5. sensors, then audio, then WCN6855 enumeration and Wi-Fi client mode.

See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for completion gates and
[port-status.md](port-status.md) for subsystem evidence.

## Safety invariants

- Never flash an experimental partition.
- Never mount phone storage or write it except for separately authorized
  BusyBox-history and possible read-induced atime effects during one fixed
  fallback ACM action.
- Never reuse a consumed live payload or retry an ambiguous execute.
- Keep private keys, host pins, firmware, and live evidence outside Git.
- Follow the [credential-isolation policy](security-automation.md).
- Keep rollback armed until fallback has been independently verified.
- Treat QEMU, static DT checks, and green CI as hardware-free evidence only.
- Publish changes only after focused tests, full CI, and independent review.
