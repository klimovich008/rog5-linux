# Test plan

Tests are ordered so a failure never hides whether the phone can be recovered. A tier is attempted only after every mandatory test in the previous tier passes.

## Tier 0 — static build checks

- Kernel source revision is pinned and recorded.
- Board DTS compiles with `dtbs_check` warnings reviewed.
- Configuration fragment contains only real symbols.
- `Image`, DTB, modules, initramfs, and boot image hashes are recorded.
- The first recovery candidate is `acm-only` and contains no
  `authorized_keys`, credentials, or host-specific SSH private keys.
- Build logs contain no errors and are retained outside Git if large.
- `verify-mainline-build.sh` validates the pinned Python hash seed, raw and
  compressed Images, artifact hashes, final boot/BTF config, and parseability
  of every comparison DTB.
- `compare-mainline-builds.sh` rejects the same directory through aliases and
  requires byte-identical configuration, raw and compressed kernels, module
  archive, metadata, and all reviewed DTBs from two fresh output directories.
- `verify-kexec-recovery-stage.sh` requires an explicit `acm-only` or `ssh`
  access mode and a separately recorded artifact SHA-256 manifest, then
  validates the staging kernel config, recovery DTB allowlist, both initramfs
  layers, nested payload hashes, boot header, AVB footer, and access material.
- The base board-DTB check requires the TLMM 52-59 reservation and all eight translated ASUS HS-PHY tuning properties.
- The recovery DTB check requires USB2 high-speed operation, a built-in FEMTO PHY, exactly one USB PHY reference, and disabled UFS, QMP/SuperSpeed, and secondary USB.
- `build-gpu-recovery-initramfs.sh` preserves the recovery init, adds exactly the three hash-pinned A660 payloads, and reproduces the same archive byte-for-byte.
- `verify-staged-arch-rootfs.sh` checks the requested packages, modules, firmware, locked accounts, key-only SSH, NetworkManager ownership, headless/no-autologin default, on-demand ttyd/Chromium, Plasma/KRDP tools, and absence of baked network or remote-desktop credentials.
- `test-screen-toggle.sh` and `test-vpn-hotspot.sh` exercise idempotent display state and AP-scoped fail-closed nftables rules without phone hardware.
- `test-load-mainline-recovery.sh` rejects non-Haven watchdog controls and rollback timeouts outside 30-900 seconds before loading kexec.
- `recovery-linux.sh preflight` requires an explicit manifest-pinned image and
  exactly one fastboot target; no candidate is selected by default and `boot`
  remains inert unless `ALLOW_TEMPORARY_BOOT=1` is explicit. Recovery ACM detection requires exact
  normalized product `ROG5_recovery`; the fallback gadget sharing
  `1d6b:0104` is a hard failure.
- Build diagnostic modules under `tools/diagnostics/` only against the exact fallback kernel, and record their local hashes before use.

## Tier 1 — boot and recovery

- `fastboot boot` reaches the 5.4 kexec staging initramfs without flashing or mounting storage.
- The first candidate exposes supervised USB ACM without credentials or SSH;
  USB networking may remain unaddressed in this sub-tier.
- The staging rollback timer returns to the installed fallback kernel.
- The v15 diagnostic maps approximately 21/31/51/71-second fallback intervals
  to pre-`/init`, wake-lock, block-backed-mount, and physical-lock paths; it
  stopped after the 31-second wake-lock result and never ran kexec.
- V16 exposed exact `ROG5_recovery`, NCM, and automatic rollback but lacked an
  ACM device node. V17 proved the RAM/storage gates and live rescan fix.
- V18 exposed credential-free ACM, proved a RAM-backed root and read-only
  physical storage, and returned through its 180-second watchdog twice. The
  separate attended kexec then passed Linux 7.1 RAM-root, zero-storage,
  ACM/NCM, watchdog, fatal-log, and automatic rollback checks.
- Before exposing USB, both stages reject any block-backed mount and use
  `BLKROSET` through `blockdev --setro`; every physical disk and partition
  must report read-only. Volatile loop, RAM, and zram devices are excluded.
- After creating the ACM function, both stages must rescan device nodes,
  require `/dev/ttyGS0`, and repeat the storage gate before ACM or UDC binding.
- The mainline payload loads, then starts only after a separate attended `kexec -e`.
- Before kexec, exactly one Haven hypervisor watchdog control is disabled and verified; a secure-watchdog deactivation failure aborts the test.
- The Linux 7.1 target reports the expected release, starts `/init`, mounts configfs, configures NCM/ACM, binds the expected UDC, creates `usb0`, and runs its independent rollback timer.
- The host enumerates the target NCM or ACM function and target SSH becomes reachable.
- If host enumeration fails, record UDC state and `usb0` carrier, allow the rollback timer to recover the phone, then capture the reserved region with `tools/diagnostics/ramoops-raw` before changing hardware enablement.
- UFS remains disabled and the target has zero block-device mounts.
- Watchdog/reset counters do not increase unexpectedly.
- A normal reboot still reaches the fallback slot.

## Tier 2 — core hardware

- USB NCM remains stable during sustained traffic.
- Battery capacity, voltage, current, temperature, and charging status are real.
- Thermal zones and CPU frequency policies are present.
- DRM connector, backlight, touch, and power button work.
- Screen-off state does not stop SSH, networking, or scheduled work.
- At least 30 minutes of idle and load operation produce no fatal kernel warnings.

## Tier 3 — networking and services

- Wi-Fi client associates and routes to the internet.
- Hotspot DHCP, DNS, NAT, and source-policy routing pass.
- Radio startup produces no modem watchdog, fatal interrupt, or WLAN RDDM.
- SSH is key-only and remote access is not exposed directly to the public internet.

## Tier 4 — display and desktop

- Plasma Desktop Wayland starts on physical DRM and KRDP shares that session.
- Screen wakes on power-button press and returns to the configured blank timeout.
- Fixed 60/90/120/144 mode selection is verified visually and from the active DRM/KScreen state.
- 60 Hz idle is the default; mode changes do not blank permanently or reset the panel.
- Remote admin UI remains available independently of the physical compositor.

## Tier 5 — GPU (opt-in, run last)

- Raw KGSL or DRM render-node open/close/open cycle succeeds repeatedly.
- `vulkaninfo --summary` succeeds at least ten consecutive times.
- A headless Vulkan submit and a rendered Wayland workload pass.
- KWin runs with hardware acceleration and without llvmpipe.
- Suspend/idle/wake cycles do not produce GMU HFI errors or IOMMU faults.
- Power use with GPU idle remains acceptable.

The script `scripts/device/kgsl-open-cycle.sh` requires `ALLOW_GPU_FAULT_TEST=1` because the current vendor driver is known to fail this tier.

## Tier 6 — observability and automation

- BPF syscall/JIT, BTF, tracepoints, kprobes, and uprobes are enabled.
- GodShell can load its ARM64 programs without verifier errors.
- The observability daemon runs as a restricted systemd service on the Arch target.
- AI/email/CV automation runs as an unprivileged account with scoped tokens and an approval queue for external actions.

## Release gates

Before any persistent flash:

- three cold boots
- three warm reboots
- one four-hour idle run with screen off
- one sustained CPU/network load run
- charging from low battery through a meaningful interval
- complete redacted report with all mandatory tiers
- verified recovery/fallback procedure
