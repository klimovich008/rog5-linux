# ROG5 current state

Updated: 2026-09-04. This is the single current-state entry point.
Facts below are accepted evidence, not a claim of freshly measured live health.

## Objective and checkpoint

The standalone Arch server migration passed. The repository/development-loop
consolidation is implemented and locally verified; publication checks remain
visible on the PR. See [results](../test-results/2026-09-04-development-consolidation.md).
The physical button trial is paused.
V15 preparation stopped before signing, claim consumption or execution.
There is no authorized storage mutation in this checkpoint.

## Accepted architecture

- Exact phone: ASUS ROG Phone 5 ZS673KS, product `lahaina`, serial
  `M5AIKN00F0353YH`, anchored side USB path `1-1.2`.
- Slot A: matched official ASUS WW33 `33.0210.0210.200`, rescue/charging.
  Charging restoration is complete; see [repair runbook](asus-charging-recovery.md).
- Installed slot B: bounded-retry recovery `340f6392…`. The superseded
  `f2a73030…` image is retained as a host restore artifact, not installed state.
- Selector v2: `persistent-native-root-wifi-overlay-v10` primary
  (manifest `6c271cfa…e3e8f5`), signed `persistent-native-root-v11` fallback.
  Abbreviated hashes here are navigation aids, never verification inputs.
- Accepted server kernel: `7.1.4-g1eea8970e87f`. Last recorded accepted boot:
  `d746db04-06f2-4f1e-af3a-015439de7746`.
- P24 `arch_root_a`: immutable Arch lower/bundle store, read-only `norecovery`.
  P23: bounded 16 GiB root OverlayFS image plus separate service-state image.
  Exactly `sda,sda23` writable across 117 UFS nodes; protected nodes stay RO.
- P23 omits ext4 `orphan_file` for ASUS 5.4 replay compatibility.
  Normal parent mount is `noexec`; overlay loop is `exec,nodev,nosuid`.
- Side-port sink charging, NCM, native Wi-Fi, systemd, key-only early SSH,
  Tailscale and sandboxed `rog5-healthd` passed; normal boot needs no host NFS.
- Pinned SSH host fingerprint:
  `SHA256:WSn4LikLHGYMmnIhkgP/D3Q42/40SW99Mh1CuOHYkhQ`.
  Host alias remains `169.254.77.2` even for the normal `10.77.0.2` address.
  Credentials and complete deployment records remain private.

## Evidence and practical limits

- [Installed reboot/start](../test-results/2026-09-03-unattended-reboot-v10.md):
  101.273 s ordinary reboot; 96.697 s powered-off start under connected power.
  These are two recorded timings, not a boot-time distribution.
- [Persistent overlay](../test-results/2026-09-02-persistent-root-overlay-v8-live.md)
  and [update/reboot fixes](../test-results/2026-09-02-persistent-overlay-update-reboot-debug.md).
- [Package update](../test-results/2026-09-02-persistent-overlay-v8-package-update.md):
  163-package signed update, persistent keyring. Live baseline lacks Landlock;
  only pacman's filesystem sandbox is disabled. Future builds require Landlock.
- [Health service](../test-results/2026-09-02-healthd-persistent-live.md),
  [Wi-Fi soak](../test-results/2026-09-02-persistent-wifi-v3-soak.md),
  [NCM soak](../test-results/2026-08-29-persistent-ncm-two-hour-pass.md),
  [Tailscale](../test-results/2026-08-30-persistent-tailscale-v11-live.md).
- A PMIC IRQ storm once caused transient UFS errors/emergency RO. Subsequent
  20/20 block reads and 2,700-second soak passed; root cause remains unproven.
- [Display V14](../test-results/2026-09-03-display-power-button-v14.md) proved
  rendering and power-key input setup. Physical toggle remains unobserved.
  Display V11–V14 are consumed; never retry them. Headless V10 is the baseline.
- On September 4 the anchored USB descriptor still identified persistent Linux,
  but pinned SSH at `10.77.0.2` returned “No route to host”. Fresh server health
  is therefore unverified; consolidation did not reboot or change the phone.

## Working authority and next action

Routine repository edits, tests, local packaging, normal commits/pushes and
scoped diagnostics already have standing authorization. Existing authorization
is not revoked by a historical checklist; do not ask repeatedly.

Preserve exact device/product/topology/slot and boot-chain checks; safe battery
and temperature; signed artifact verification; storage scope and backups;
slot-A rescue and V11 fallback; permanent non-retry after COMMIT or ambiguous
execution. No experimental flash, GPT change or protected-data write belongs
to this consolidation. Destructive storage requires a separately reviewed
exact operation and explicit approval. Never publish private material.

Read [development workflow](development.md) for commands and validation tiers.
Read only relevant R1–R10 entries in [lessons](development-lessons.md) during
routine edits; use its complete pre-build/live checklists before a successor.
Confirm the existing server's transport/health with read-only diagnostics
before resuming the operator-attended screen test.
The [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md) holds later work.
